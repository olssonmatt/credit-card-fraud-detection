# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection
 - Credit card fraud detection model for the Kaggle dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud)
 - A quick project aimed be a proof of concept as well as an effort to bolster the explainations models

## Description
 - In this dataset, there are a number of transactions and only a small number of them are fraudulent. This allows us to calculate the percent of fraudulent transactions. To direct this into a model, we consider the percent of fraudulent transactions to be the probability of any given transaction to be linked to fraud. Consider the formula, $y = m_1 x_1 + m_2 x_2 + ... + m_n x_n + b$. In this formula, there are $x_n$ variables that influence $y$. In this case, $y$, takes the places of the probability of a fraudulent transaction, the $x$ variables relate to the columns provided in the data set, and $b$ is some intercept of the line.
