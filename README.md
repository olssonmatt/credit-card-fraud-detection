# credit-card-fraud-detection
 - Credit card fraud detection model for the Kaggle dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud)
 - A quick project aimed be a proof of concept as well as an effort to bolster the explainations models

## 
 - In this dataset, there are a number of transactions and only a small number of them are fraudulent
 - This allows us to calculate the percent of fraudulent transactions
 - To direct this into a model, we consider the percent of fraudulent transactions to be the probability of any given transaction to be linked to fraud
 - Consider the formula for a line, $y = mx + b$
